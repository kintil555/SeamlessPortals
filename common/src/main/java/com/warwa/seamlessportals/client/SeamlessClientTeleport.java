/**

 *       from {@code LocalPlayerMixin.tick} HEAD (or the per-frame camera
 *       detector) the instant the client detects its own crossing of a portal
 *       plane, with the detection movement segment (its depth sign = the
 *       crossing direction). Does the visual swap (promote cached renderer,
 *       re-level player, demote outgoing) and sends
 *       {@link ModPayloads.ClientPortalCrossingPayload} to the server.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #handleServerReconcile} — called when
 *       {@link ModPayloads.ClientboundSeamlessMovePayload} arrives from the
 *       server. Hot path: confirms our client-first swap was correct.
 *       Fallback path: if client never detected the crossing (no cached
 *       renderer for the dest dim yet, or portal link not synced), the
 *       visual swap is deferred to the packet handler and runs now.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Equivalent to what {@code HandleRespawnMixin.seamlessportals$redirectSetLevel}
 * does inside {@code handleRespawn}, but independent of the respawn-packet
 * flow. The old mixin remains in place for non-seamless cross-dim respawns
 * (death, command teleport, etc.) but is no longer exercised for portal
 * crossings once both ends of this pipeline are in place.
